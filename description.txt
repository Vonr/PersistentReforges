Have you ever gotten annoyed that upgrading your accessories through crafting removes the base accessories' reforges?
With this mod, reforges can be persisted to the upgraded accessory!

Configuration options:
- Selection Mode (default: Rarest)
    - Rarest: Picks the rarest reforge (random if tied) from ingredients with reforges
    - Least Rare: Picks the least rare reforge (random if tied) from ingredients with reforges
    - Random: Picks a random reforge from ingredients with reforges
- Chance (0.0 - 1.0 (Always), default: 1.0): The chance that a reforge transfers. Overrides random reforges given on craft.
