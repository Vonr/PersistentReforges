# Persistent Reforges

Have you ever gotten annoyed that upgrading your accessories through crafting removes the base accessories' reforges?

With this mod, reforges can be persisted to the upgraded accessory!

### Configuration Options
- Selection Mode (default: Highest Value)
  - Highest Value: Picks the most valuable reforge (random if tied) from ingredients with reforges
  - Lowest Value: Picks the least valuable reforge (random if tied) from ingredients with reforges
  - Rarest: Picks the rarest reforge (random if tied) from ingredients with reforges
  - Least Rare: Picks the least rare reforge (random if tied) from ingredients with reforges
  - Random: Picks a random reforge from ingredients with reforges
- Chance (0.0 - 1.0 (Always), default: 1.0): The chance that a reforge transfers. Overrides random reforges given on craft.
- Persist Bad Reforges (default: false): Whether bad reforges (ones that decrease the item's value) will persist through crafts.
